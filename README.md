Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.

the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Bourbon Smash](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/bourbon-smash) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/bourbon-foundations.git
    cd bourbon-foundations
    bin/setup

You can then start the server to view the styles with:

     bundle exec middleman server

Your goal is to refactor the provided styles using Bourbon's mixins to simplify the style rules as you go.
